      # "${GITHUB_REPOSITORY#*/}" evaluates into the name of the repository
      # using --public-url something will allow trunk to modify all the href paths like from favicon.ico to repo_name/favicon.ico .
      # this is necessary for github pages where the site is deployed to username.github.io/repo_name and all files must be requested
      # relatively as favicon.ico. if we skip public-url option, the href paths will instead request username.github.io/favicon.ico which
      # will obviously return error 404 not found.
